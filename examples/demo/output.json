To do this, we need to look for anomalies or values that deviate significantly from the rest of the sample.\n\n- **Outliers Analysis:** Since outliers are often considered as data points that fall outside 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile and below the first quartile, let's find potential outliers:\n\nWe have 14 data points, and for such a small dataset, simple observation of the sorted data might also be adequate to spot any extremes.\n\nObservations:\n- The values 10 and 90 are at the far ends of the dataset and might be considered potential outliers due to their relative isolation compared to the rest.\n\nNow, combining these observations into a written summary part. Would this be the final step, or do you want the summary information updated?"
