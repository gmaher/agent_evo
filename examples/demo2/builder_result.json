They will write the code for game mechanics, including the player controls, collision detection, and scoring system.\n\n4. **Tester**: This agent will test the game to ensure it is fully playable and debug any issues.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\nCreate the game flappy bird in html javascript and css\n\nThe game should be complete and fully playable.\n\nIt should have a start screen, and when the game ends there should be a gameover screen with a restart button that restarts the game.\n\nAll the features of the original game should be reproduced.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\nGuidelines:\n- Think carefully about what types of agents are needed (e.g., researcher, writer, coder, analyst)\n- Design appropriate tools for the task (file operations, calculations, search, etc.)\n- Create clear system prompts that give each agent a specific role and expertise\n- Design the delegation flow logically - who should start, who should delegate to whom\n- Keep the team as simple as possible while still being effective\n- Each agent should have a clear, focused responsibility\n\nThe files should be created in the following paths:\n- ../examples/demo2/tools.json\n- ../examples/demo2/agents.json\n- ../examples/demo2/team.json\n\nMake sure the JSON files are properly formatted and follow the expected schema.\n\nExample schemas:\n\ntools.json:\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"tool_1\",\n      \"name\": \"search\",\n      \"description\": \"Search for information\",\n      \"parameters\": [...],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Search results\"},\n      \"code\": \"def search(query): ...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nagents.json:\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"agent_1\",\n      \"name\": \"Researcher\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a research specialist...\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"tool_1\"],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nteam.json:\n{\n  \"id\": \"team_1\",\n  \"name\": \"Task Team\",\n  \"description\": \"Team for solving the task\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"agent_1\", \"agent_2\"],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\"from\": \"agent_1\", \"to\": \"agent_2\", \"description\": \"Pass findings\"}\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"agent_1\"\n}\n\n\n[TeamArchitect]:\nTo create the game \"Flappy Bird\" in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, we need to form a team of AI agents with distinct roles. Let's break down the task and design the team structure accordingly.\n\n### Task Breakdown and Team Structure\n\n1. **Researcher**: This agent will research the features and mechanics of the original Flappy Bird game. They will document the necessary components, such as game physics, scoring system, and user interface elements.\n\n2. **Game Designer**: This agent will design the game's structure, including the HTML layout, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic. They will use the research findings to ensure all features are accurately represented.\n\n3. **Coder**: This agent will implement the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They will write the code for game mechanics, including the player controls, collision detection, and scoring system.\n\n4. **Tester**: This agent will test the game to ensure it is fully playable and debug any issues. They will provide feedback to the coder if any adjustments are needed.\n\n5. **Documentation Specialist**: This agent will create documentation for the game's code, explaining the logic and structure.

Let's break down the task and design the team structure accordingly.\n\n### Task Breakdown and Team Structure\n\n1. **Researcher**: This agent will research the features and mechanics of the original Flappy Bird game. They will document the necessary components, such as game physics, scoring system, and user interface elements.\n\n2. **Game Designer**: This agent will design the game's structure, including the HTML layout, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic. They will use the research findings to ensure all features are accurately represented.\n\n3. **Coder**: This agent will implement the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They will write the code for game mechanics, including the player controls, collision detection, and scoring system.\n\n4. **Tester**: This agent will test the game to ensure it is fully playable and debug any issues. They will provide feedback to the coder if any adjustments are needed.\n\n5. **Documentation Specialist**: This agent will create documentation for the game's code, explaining the logic and structure. This will be useful for future updates or modifications.\n\n### Tools Needed\n\n- **File Editor**: To create and modify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.\n- **Web Browser**: To test and run the game.\n- **Debugger**: To identify and fix any issues in the code.\n\n### JSON Files Design\n\n#### tools.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_editor\",\n      \"name\": \"File Editor\",\n      \"description\": \"Tool for editing files\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"file_path\", \"content\"],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Success status\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"web_browser\",\n      \"name\": \"Web Browser\",\n      \"description\": \"Tool for running and testing web applications\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"url\"],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Page output\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"debugger\",\n      \"name\": \"Debugger\",\n      \"description\": \"Tool for debugging code\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"file_path\"],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Debugging report\"}\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"researcher\",\n      \"name\": \"Researcher\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a research specialist focused on analyzing games.\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"game_designer\",\n      \"name\": \"Game Designer\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You design game structures and layouts based on research findings.\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"file_editor\"],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"coder\",\n      \"name\": \"Coder\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You write and implement code for games.\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"file_editor\", \"debugger\"],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"tester\",\n      \"name\": \"Tester\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You test games to ensure they are fully functional and debug as needed.\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"web_browser\", \"debugger\"],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"documentation_specialist\",\n      \"name\": \"Documentation Specialist\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You create detailed documentation for code and projects.\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"file_editor\"],\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### team.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"flappy_bird_team\",\n  \"name\": \"Flappy Bird Development Team\",\n  \"description\": \"Team dedicated to creating the Flappy Bird game.\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"researcher\", \"game_designer\", \"coder\", \"tester\", \"documentation_specialist\"],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\"from\": \"researcher\", \"to\": \"game_designer\", \"description\": \"Provide research findings\"},\n    {\"from\": \"game_designer\", \"to\": \"coder\", \"description\": \"Design game structure\"},\n    {\"from\": \"coder\", \"to\": \"tester\", \"description\": \"Deliver code for testing\"},\n    {\"from\": \"tester\", \"to\": \"coder\", \"description\": \"Feedback on issues\"},\n    {\"from\": \"coder\", \"to\": \"documentation_specialist\", \"description\": \"Provide final code for documentation\"}\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"researcher\"\n}\n```\n\nNow, I will delegate the creation of these JSON files to the Tool Designer. \n\n[DELEGATE: tool_designer]\nCreate the JSON files based on the provided designs:\n\n- ../examples/demo2/tools.json\n- ../examples/demo2/agents.json\n- ../examples/demo2/team.json\n\nEnsure the files are properly formatted and follow the expected schema.\n\n=== Your Task ===\nCreate the JSON files based on the provided designs:\n\n- ../examples/demo2/tools.json\n- ../examples/demo2/agents.json\n- ../examples/demo2/team.json\n\nEnsure the files are properly formatted and follow the expected schema."
