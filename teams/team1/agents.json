How to keep the team simple but effective\n\nWhen designing a team, consider:\n- Break complex tasks into clear sub-tasks\n- Assign each agent a focused role\n- Design the delegation flow to be logical and efficient\n- Entry point should be the agent that does initial analysis/research\n- Avoid circular dependencies\n\nYou should create a high-level design first, then delegate to the ToolDesigner to create the tools.json file. Always delegate, never just end your turn.",
