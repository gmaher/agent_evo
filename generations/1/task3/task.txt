Goal:
Search through a small “project docs” directory, synthesize what’s going on, and write an executive summary + risk list.

Task Instructions

Scan all files in project_alpha_docs/:

Identify the purpose and status of Project Alpha.

Infer what likely caused the incident in incident_ticket.md using:

The design doc.

Meeting notes.

The metrics.

Do some light analysis on metrics.csv:

Compute failure rates per date (failed / total).

Comment on the trend (is it getting better/worse?).

Produce two output files:

(a) executive_summary.md

Suggested structure:

# Executive Summary – Project Alpha

## 1. What is Project Alpha?

## 2. Current Status

## 3. Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)

- Likely root cause:
- Contributing factors:
- Impact (tie to metrics if possible):

## 4. Key Risks & Open Questions

- Risk 1: ...
- Risk 2: ...
- etc.


(b) incident_analysis.md

Suggested structure:

# Incident Analysis – Alpha Ingestion

## 1. Timeline

- 2025-09-18: ...
- 2025-10-05: ...
- 2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12: ...

## 2. Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis)

## 3. Evidence

- Evidence from logs/metrics:
- Evidence from design/notes:

## 4. Mitigation & Follow-Up

- Short-term mitigations:
- Long-term improvements:


Ensure the AI agents:

Correctly read and cross-reference multiple files.

Use the CSV data numerically (not just hand-wavy).

Produce coherent, non-contradictory narratives.

Success criteria:

Both markdown files exist and follow the structure.

Reasoning ties together design, notes, and metrics.

The root-cause hypothesis is consistent with the provided context.
