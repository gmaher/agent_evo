Internal notes (not for customers):

- Strongest value props:
  * Reducing ramp-up time for new hires.
  * Reducing errors in complex multi-step workflows.
  * Making tribal knowledge explicit and shareable.

- We often get compared to:
  * RPA vendors (legacy, heavy, enterprise).
  * Browser automation extensions.
  * "AI agents" that try to operate the computer autonomously.

- Concerns from prospects:
  * "Will this break when the UI changes?"
  * "How secure is it?"
  * "Will non-technical users actually adopt it?"

Questions for research:
1. What are 2–3 notable competitors in desktop/web workflow automation or AI agents land?
2. How do they position themselves (target users, key features, pricing hints)?
3. What are common concerns / objections in this category?
