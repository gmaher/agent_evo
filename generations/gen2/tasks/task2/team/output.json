Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\nTask Instructions\n\nRead company_overview.md and internal_notes.txt.\n\nUse the web to:\n\nIdentify 2\u20133 relevant competitors in the workflow-automation / AI-agents space.\n\nFor each competitor, gather:\n\nTarget users.\n\nCore features / product positioning.\n\nAny high-level pricing information (or pricing style: free tier, per-seat, usage-based, etc.).\n\nIdentify common buyer concerns or objections across the space (e.g., security, reliability, change management).\n\nProduce a report market_brief.md with the following structure:\n\n# Market Brief \u2013 Workflow Automation & AI Agents\n\n## 1. Quick Summary (1\u20132 paragraphs)\n\n## 2. Our Positioning (Acme Workflow Automation)\n- Short recap of what Acme does (based on local files).\n\n## 3. Competitor Snapshot\n\n### 3.1 <Competitor 1>\n- Target users:\n- Positioning:\n- Key features:\n- Pricing model:\n- Notes on how they differ from Acme:\n\n### 3.2 <Competitor 2>\n...\n\n## 4. Common Buyer Concerns / Objections\n\n- Concern 1: ...\n- Concern 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n## 5. Opportunities for Acme\n\n- 3\u20135 bullet points on how Acme could differentiate or message better.\n\n\nEnsure:\n\nAll facts pulled from the web are consistent and up-to-date.\n\nInformation from local files is correctly integrated (don\u2019t contradict it).\n\nThe report is written in clear, concise business language.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nmarket_brief.md exists and follows the requested structure.\n\nIt references both local context and web findings.\n\nCompetitor details are specific enough to be plausible (not generic fluff).\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\nTask Instructions\n\nRead company_overview.md and internal_notes.txt.\n\nUse the web to:\n\nIdentify 2\u20133 relevant competitors in the workflow-automation / AI-agents space.\n\nFor each competitor, gather:\n\nTarget users.\n\nCore features / product positioning.\n\nAny high-level pricing information (or pricing style: free tier, per-seat, usage-based, etc.).\n\nIdentify common buyer concerns or objections across the space (e.g., security, reliability, change management).\n\nProduce a report market_brief.md with the following structure:\n\n# Market Brief \u2013 Workflow Automation & AI Agents\n\n## 1. Quick Summary (1\u20132 paragraphs)\n\n## 2. Our Positioning (Acme Workflow Automation)\n- Short recap of what Acme does (based on local files).\n\n## 3. Competitor Snapshot\n\n### 3.1 <Competitor 1>\n- Target users:\n- Positioning:\n- Key features:\n- Pricing model:\n- Notes on how they differ from Acme:\n\n### 3.2 <Competitor 2>\n...\n\n## 4. Common Buyer Concerns / Objections\n\n- Concern 1: ...\n- Concern 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n## 5. Opportunities for Acme\n\n- 3\u20135 bullet points on how Acme could differentiate or message better.\n\n\nEnsure:\n\nAll facts pulled from the web are consistent and up-to-date.\n\nInformation from local files is correctly integrated (don\u2019t contradict it).\n\nThe report is written in clear, concise business language.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nmarket_brief.md exists and follows the requested structure.\n\nIt references both local context and web findings.\n\nCompetitor details are specific enough to be plausible (not generic fluff).\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\nTask Instructions\n\nRead company_overview.md and internal_notes.txt.\n\nUse the web to:\n\nIdentify 2\u20133 relevant competitors in the workflow-automation / AI-agents space.\n\nFor each competitor, gather:\n\nTarget users.\n\nCore features / product positioning.\n\nAny high-level pricing information (or pricing style: free tier, per-seat, usage-based, etc.).\n\nIdentify common buyer concerns or objections across the space (e.g., security, reliability, change management).\n\nProduce a report market_brief.md with the following structure:\n\n# Market Brief \u2013 Workflow Automation & AI Agents\n\n## 1. Quick Summary (1\u20132 paragraphs)\n\n## 2. Our Positioning (Acme Workflow Automation)\n- Short recap of what Acme does (based on local files).\n\n## 3.

Opportunities for Acme\n\n- 3\u20135 bullet points on how Acme could differentiate or message better.\n\n\nEnsure:\n\nAll facts pulled from the web are consistent and up-to-date.\n\nInformation from local files is correctly integrated (don\u2019t contradict it).\n\nThe report is written in clear, concise business language.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nmarket_brief.md exists and follows the requested structure.\n\nIt references both local context and web findings.\n\nCompetitor details are specific enough to be plausible (not generic fluff).\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #
