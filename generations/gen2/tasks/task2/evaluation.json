Quick Summary (1\u20132 paragraphs)\n\n## 2. Our Positioning (Acme Workflow Automation)\n- Short recap of what Acme does (based on local files).\n\n## 3. Competitor Snapshot\n\n### 3.1 <Competitor 1>\n- Target users:\n- Positioning:\n- Key features:\n- Pricing model:\n- Notes on how they differ from Acme:\n\n### 3.2 <Competitor 2>\n...\n\n## 4. Common Buyer Concerns / Objections\n\n- Concern 1: ...\n- Concern 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n## 5. Opportunities for Acme\n\n- 3\u20135 bullet points on how Acme could differentiate or message better.\n\n\nEnsure:\n\nAll facts pulled from the web are consistent and up-to-date.\n\nInformation from local files is correctly integrated (don\u2019t contradict it).\n\nThe report is written in clear, concise business language.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nmarket_brief.md exists and follows the requested structure.\n\nIt references both local context and web findings.\n\nCompetitor details are specific enough to be plausible (not generic fluff).",
  "score": 5.0,
  "reasoning": "The task was partially completed. The team successfully read the local files and created a market brief document, but there were significant issues in the execution that prevented full success. The main problem was the failure of the web search tool, which resulted in a lack of specific competitor information. This is a critical component of the task, as the report requires detailed competitor analysis based on current web data. Without this information, the report cannot meet the requirements of being specific and up-to-date.\n\nWhat was done well:\n- The team correctly read and integrated the information from the local files into the market brief.\n- The structure of the market brief document followed the requested format, indicating that the team understood the task requirements.\n\nWhat was missing:\n- The web search tool failed, and the team did not address this issue, leading to a lack of competitor-specific information in the report.\n- The report likely contains generic information about competitors, as the specific web data was not retrieved.\n- There was no evidence of identifying common buyer concerns or objections from the web, which is a key part of the task.\n- Opportunities for Acme were not mentioned in the provided execution details, which is another requirement of the task.\n\nOverall, the task was not completed successfully due to the failure to gather and integrate crucial web-based competitor information.",
