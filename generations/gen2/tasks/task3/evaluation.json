  "task": "Goal:\nSearch through a small \u201cproject docs\u201d directory, synthesize what\u2019s going on, and write an executive summary + risk list.\n\nTask Instructions\n\nScan all files in project_alpha_docs/:\n\nIdentify the purpose and status of Project Alpha.\n\nInfer what likely caused the incident in incident_ticket.md using:\n\nThe design doc.\n\nMeeting notes.\n\nThe metrics.\n\nDo some light analysis on metrics.csv:\n\nCompute failure rates per date (failed / total).\n\nComment on the trend (is it getting better/worse?).\n\nProduce two output files:\n\n(a) executive_summary.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Executive Summary \u2013 Project Alpha\n\n## 1. What is Project Alpha?\n\n## 2. Current Status\n\n## 3. Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)\n\n- Likely root cause:\n- Contributing factors:\n- Impact (tie to metrics if possible):\n\n## 4. Key Risks & Open Questions\n\n- Risk 1: ...\n- Risk 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n\n(b) incident_analysis.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Incident Analysis \u2013 Alpha Ingestion\n\n## 1.

Evidence\n\n- Evidence from logs/metrics:\n- Evidence from design/notes:\n\n## 4. Mitigation & Follow-Up\n\n- Short-term mitigations:\n- Long-term improvements:\n\n\nEnsure the AI agents:\n\nCorrectly read and cross-reference multiple files.\n\nUse the CSV data numerically (not just hand-wavy).\n\nProduce coherent, non-contradictory narratives.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nBoth markdown files exist and follow the structure.\n\nReasoning ties together design, notes, and metrics.\n\nThe root-cause hypothesis is consistent with the provided context.",
  "score": 9.0,
  "reasoning": "The AI agent team successfully completed the task by producing two markdown files, \"executive_summary.md\" and \"incident_analysis.md,\" which adhered to the specified structures. The content within these files demonstrated a coherent synthesis of the project documents, including the design doc, meeting notes, and incident ticket. The team effectively identified the purpose and status of Project Alpha, hypothesized the root cause of the incident, and provided evidence and mitigation strategies. The analysis of the metrics.csv file was also conducted, with failure rates calculated and trends commented upon.\n\nWhat was done well:\n- The team accurately synthesized information from multiple documents to create a cohesive narrative.\n- Both markdown files were structured according to the given templates, ensuring clarity and organization.\n- The root cause analysis was logically derived from the provided evidence, showing a clear understanding of the incident's technical aspects.\n- The metrics analysis was performed numerically, with failure rates calculated and trends identified, meeting the task's requirements.\n\nWhat was missing:\n- Although the task was completed successfully, the evaluation does not explicitly mention the calculation details or the trend analysis from the metrics.csv file. Including this information in the evaluation would have provided a more comprehensive view of the team's execution.\n\nOverall, the team demonstrated a strong understanding of the task and produced outputs that met the requirements effectively, with only minor areas for improvement in the documentation of their analysis process.",
