Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\nGoal:\nSearch through a small \u201cproject docs\u201d directory, synthesize what\u2019s going on, and write an executive summary + risk list.\n\nTask Instructions\n\nScan all files in project_alpha_docs/:\n\nIdentify the purpose and status of Project Alpha.\n\nInfer what likely caused the incident in incident_ticket.md using:\n\nThe design doc.\n\nMeeting notes.\n\nThe metrics.\n\nDo some light analysis on metrics.csv:\n\nCompute failure rates per date (failed / total).\n\nComment on the trend (is it getting better/worse?).\n\nProduce two output files:\n\n(a) executive_summary.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Executive Summary \u2013 Project Alpha\n\n## 1. What is Project Alpha?\n\n## 2. Current Status\n\n## 3. Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)\n\n- Likely root cause:\n- Contributing factors:\n- Impact (tie to metrics if possible):\n\n## 4. Key Risks & Open Questions\n\n- Risk 1: ...\n- Risk 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n\n(b) incident_analysis.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Incident Analysis \u2013 Alpha Ingestion\n\n## 1. Timeline\n\n- 2025-09-18: ...\n- 2025-10-05: ...\n- 2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12: ...\n\n## 2. Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis)\n\n## 3. Evidence\n\n- Evidence from logs/metrics:\n- Evidence from design/notes:\n\n## 4. Mitigation & Follow-Up\n\n- Short-term mitigations:\n- Long-term improvements:\n\n\nEnsure the AI agents:\n\nCorrectly read and cross-reference multiple files.\n\nUse the CSV data numerically (not just hand-wavy).\n\nProduce coherent, non-contradictory narratives.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nBoth markdown files exist and follow the structure.\n\nReasoning ties together design, notes, and metrics.\n\nThe root-cause hypothesis is consistent with the provided context.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

Mitigation & Follow-Up\n\n- Short-term mitigations:\n- Long-term improvements:\n\n\nEnsure the AI agents:\n\nCorrectly read and cross-reference multiple files.\n\nUse the CSV data numerically (not just hand-wavy).\n\nProduce coherent, non-contradictory narratives.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nBoth markdown files exist and follow the structure.\n\nReasoning ties together design, notes, and metrics.\n\nThe root-cause hypothesis is consistent with the provided context.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #
