  "task": "Goal:\nSearch through a small \u201cproject docs\u201d directory, synthesize what\u2019s going on, and write an executive summary + risk list.\n\nTask Instructions\n\nScan all files in project_alpha_docs/:\n\nIdentify the purpose and status of Project Alpha.\n\nInfer what likely caused the incident in incident_ticket.md using:\n\nThe design doc.\n\nMeeting notes.\n\nThe metrics.\n\nDo some light analysis on metrics.csv:\n\nCompute failure rates per date (failed / total).\n\nComment on the trend (is it getting better/worse?).\n\nProduce two output files:\n\n(a) executive_summary.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Executive Summary \u2013 Project Alpha\n\n## 1. What is Project Alpha?\n\n## 2. Current Status\n\n## 3. Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)\n\n- Likely root cause:\n- Contributing factors:\n- Impact (tie to metrics if possible):\n\n## 4. Key Risks & Open Questions\n\n- Risk 1: ...\n- Risk 2: ...\n- etc.\n\n\n(b) incident_analysis.md\n\nSuggested structure:\n\n# Incident Analysis \u2013 Alpha Ingestion\n\n## 1.

Evidence\n\n- Evidence from logs/metrics:\n- Evidence from design/notes:\n\n## 4. Mitigation & Follow-Up\n\n- Short-term mitigations:\n- Long-term improvements:\n\n\nEnsure the AI agents:\n\nCorrectly read and cross-reference multiple files.\n\nUse the CSV data numerically (not just hand-wavy).\n\nProduce coherent, non-contradictory narratives.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nBoth markdown files exist and follow the structure.\n\nReasoning ties together design, notes, and metrics.\n\nThe root-cause hypothesis is consistent with the provided context.",
  "score": 8.0,
  "reasoning": "The task was executed well, with both required markdown files, `executive_summary.md` and `incident_analysis.md`, being created successfully. The content within these files aligns with the task requirements, providing a coherent narrative that ties together the design, meeting notes, and metrics. The executive summary clearly outlines the purpose and status of Project Alpha, identifies the likely root cause of the incident, and lists key risks. Similarly, the incident analysis provides a timeline, technical root cause hypothesis, evidence, and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe team effectively used the provided documents to infer the root cause of the incident and linked it to the metrics, demonstrating a good understanding of the task. The failure rates were calculated and commented on, showing a trend of improvement, which was a key requirement.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement. The analysis could have been more detailed, particularly in the evidence section, where more specific metrics or logs could have been referenced to strengthen the hypothesis. Additionally, while the files were created and overwritten successfully, the execution history lacks detailed steps or insights into how the CSV data was analyzed numerically, which is crucial for transparency and verification.\n\nOverall, the task was completed to a high standard, with minor gaps in detail and transparency preventing a perfect score.",
