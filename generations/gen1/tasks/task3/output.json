Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)\n- Likely root cause: The validation function read entire files into memory, causing failures for large uploads.\n- Contributing factors: The backend API's inability to handle files larger than 10MB efficiently.\n- Impact (tie to metrics if possible): Approximately 10\u201315% of large uploads failed, as reflected in the incident ticket.\n\n## 4.

Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis)\nThe validation function reading entire files into memory led to failures with large-file uploads.\n\n## 3. Evidence\n- Evidence from logs/metrics: Decreasing failure rates over time suggest improvements in handling uploads.\n- Evidence from design/notes: Meeting notes confirm the memory issue and ongoing fixes.\n\n## 4.

What is Project Alpha?\nProject Alpha is a data ingestion service that allows users to upload CSV files, which are then validated and stored for analytics processing.\n\n## 2. Current Status\nThe project is operational, with recent improvements in handling large-file uploads. A basic job status page is implemented, and further UX enhancements are planned.\n\n## 3. Recent Incident (2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12)\n- Likely root cause: The validation function read entire files into memory, causing failures for large uploads.\n- Contributing factors: The backend API's inability to handle files larger than 10MB efficiently.\n- Impact (tie to metrics if possible): Approximately 10\u201315% of large uploads failed, as reflected in the incident ticket.\n\n## 4. Key Risks & Open Questions\n- Risk 1: Continued issues with large-file uploads if the current fix is insufficient.\n- Risk 2: Inconsistencies in delimiter usage and timezone handling.\n- Open Question: How will the team handle delimiter and timezone inconsistencies moving forward?\nEND_ARG\nEND_TOOL_CALL\n\n### Creating `incident_analysis.md`\n\nBEGIN_TOOL_CALL write_file\nBEGIN_ARG file_path\nincident_analysis.md\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG content\n# Incident Analysis \u2013 Alpha Ingestion\n\n## 1.

Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis)\nThe validation function reading entire files into memory led to failures with large-file uploads.\n\n## 3. Evidence\n- Evidence from logs/metrics: Decreasing failure rates over time suggest improvements in handling uploads.\n- Evidence from design/notes: Meeting notes confirm the memory issue and ongoing fixes.\n\n## 4. Mitigation & Follow-Up\n- Short-term mitigations: Implement line-by-line processing for validation.\n- Long-term improvements: Develop a robust streaming validator and address delimiter/timezone inconsistencies.\nEND_ARG\nEND_TOOL_CALL\n\nBoth markdown files have been created successfully, synthesizing the information from the project documents and metrics. <FINISHED>"
