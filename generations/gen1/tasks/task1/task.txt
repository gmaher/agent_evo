# Task Instructions

Diagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.

# equested Changes

Fix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.
Add a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.
Update this README with a short "Change Log" section documenting what was done.

# Instructions

Open and understand app.py and README.md.

Reproduce the bug:

Add a todo.

Mark it done.

Run python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.

Fix the persistence bug in save_todos.

Add a delete <id> command that:

Removes the todo with the given 1-based ID.

Handles invalid IDs gracefully.

Update README.md:

Add a Change Log section summarizing:

The bug fix.

The new delete command.

Run a small “manual test matrix” and write the results to test_results.md:

Show example commands and their outputs before and after changes.

Success criteria:

Re-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.

delete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.

README and test_results.md exist and are coherent.
