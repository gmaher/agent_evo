      "task": "You are an AI team builder. Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. A tools.json file containing any custom tools the agents might need\n2. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n3. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Tool Design Principles:**\n- Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- Tool code must be complete and functional Python code\n- Include proper error handling in tool implementations\n- Tools should return structured, useful data\n- Avoid overlapping functionality between tools\n- Consider file I/O, data processing, API calls, and computational tools\n- CODE MUST BE COMPLETE, NO PLACEHOLDER CODE\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**tools.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"file_writer\",\n      \"name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"description\": \"Write content to a file with proper error handling\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"path\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"File path relative to current directory\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"content\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Content to write to the file\",\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"mode\",\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Write mode: 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"default\": \"w\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success message or error\"},\n      \"code\": \"def write_file(path, content, mode='w'):\n    import os\n    try:\n        #

Agent system prompts should be detailed (3-5 sentences minimum)\n3. Team structure should follow a logical workflow\n4. Include all necessary parameters and error handling\n5. Make the team as sophisticated as needed while maintaining clarity\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json, agents.json and tools.json file."
