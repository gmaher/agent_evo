      "task": "You are an AI team builder. Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

The files should be created in these exact paths:\n- agents.json  \n- team.json\n\nRemember:\n1. Agent system prompts should be detailed (5 sentences minimum, preferably more)\n2. Team structure should follow a logical workflow\n3. Include all necessary parameters and error handling\n4. Make the team as sophisticated as needed while maintaining clarity\n5.

Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

The files should be created in these exact paths:\n- agents.json  \n- team.json\n\nRemember:\n1. Agent system prompts should be detailed (5 sentences minimum, preferably more)\n2. Team structure should follow a logical workflow\n3. Include all necessary parameters and error handling\n4. Make the team as sophisticated as needed while maintaining clarity\n5. Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Make sure to follow exactly the keys and types from the JSON examples above\n\n=== JSON SCHEMAS ===\n\n**agents.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n      \"name\": \"string (agent display name)\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"string (detailed agent personality and instructions)\",\n      \"tool_ids\": [\"string (tool id)\", ...],\n      \"temperature\": number (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.7),\n      \"max_retries\": number (optional, default 3)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n**team.json Schema:**\n{\n  \"id\": \"string (unique identifier)\",\n  \"name\": \"string (team display name)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (team purpose)\",\n  \"agent_ids\": [\"string (agent id)\", ...],\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"string (source agent id)\",\n      \"to\": \"string (target agent id)\",\n      \"description\": \"string (delegation purpose)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entry_point\": \"string (starting agent id)\"\n}\n\nBegin by understanding the task requirements, then design your team accordingly.\nYou ABSOLUTLEY must use the file_writer tool to create a team.json and agents.json files.\n\n[Task Analyst]:\nTo tackle this task, we need to create a team of specialized AI agents that can effectively handle the diagnosis and resolution of a bug in a Python todo app, implement a new feature, and update the documentation. Here's a breakdown of the roles and the team structure:\n\n### Agents Required:\n\n1. **Task Analyst**: Understands the task requirements, breaks down the task, and delegates to the appropriate agents. This agent will serve as the entry point.\n2. **Bug Fixer**: Specializes in understanding and fixing bugs in Python applications.\n3. **Feature Developer**: Focused on implementing new features in Python applications.\n4. **Documentation Specialist**: Updates and maintains documentation.\n5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the application to ensure the bug is fixed and the new feature works as expected.\n\n### Team Structure:\n\n- **Task Analyst** will act as the entry point, analyzing and delegating tasks to the **Bug Fixer** and **Feature Developer**.\n- **Bug Fixer** will diagnose and fix the persistence bug in the todo app.\n- **Feature Developer** will add the new delete command feature.\n- **Documentation Specialist** will create and update the change log in README.md.\n- **QA Engineer** will test the application and document the test results in test_results.md.\n\nLet's create the `agents.json` and `team.json` files to define this team:\n\n#### agents.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"task_analyst\",\n      \"name\": \"Task Analyst\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a Task Analyst specializing in breaking down complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.

Your job is to design and create a team of AI agents that can solve the following task:\n\n=== ORIGINAL TASK ===\n# Task Instructions\n\nDiagnose and fix a bug in a tiny Python todo app, then add a small feature and update the docs.\n\n# equested Changes\n\nFix the bug where marking a todo as done does not persist after restarting the program.\nAdd a new command: delete <id> to remove a todo by its ID.\nUpdate this README with a short \"Change Log\" section documenting what was done.\n\n# Instructions\n\nOpen and understand app.py and README.md.\n\nReproduce the bug:\n\nAdd a todo.\n\nMark it done.\n\nRun python app.py list again after restarting the program and confirm the status is not persisted.\n\nFix the persistence bug in save_todos.\n\nAdd a delete <id> command that:\n\nRemoves the todo with the given 1-based ID.\n\nHandles invalid IDs gracefully.\n\nUpdate README.md:\n\nAdd a Change Log section summarizing:\n\nThe bug fix.\n\nThe new delete command.\n\nRun a small \u201cmanual test matrix\u201d and write the results to test_results.md:\n\nShow example commands and their outputs before and after changes.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nRe-running the script after marking a todo done still shows it as done.\n\ndelete <id> works and keeps the list consistent.\n\nREADME and test_results.md exist and are coherent.\n\n=== YOUR OBJECTIVE ===\nYou need to create:\n1. An agents.json file defining the agents with appropriate system prompts and tool access\n2. A team.json file defining the team structure and delegation flow\n\n=== GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEAMS ===\n\n**Agent Design Principles:**\n- Give each agent a clear, focused role with specific expertise\n- System prompts should be detailed and include:\n  * The agent's expertise and background\n  * How they should approach problems\n  * Their communication style\n  * When they should delegate vs handle tasks themselves\n- Agents should have access only to tools relevant to their role\n- Consider the cognitive load - don't make agents too broad\n\n**Team Structure Principles:**\n- Design a logical flow from requirements gathering to implementation\n- Entry point should be an agent that can understand and break down the task\n- Create clear handoff points between agents\n- Avoid cycles - design a directed acyclic graph when possible\n- Each edge should represent a meaningful delegation with clear purpose\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- Tools include comprehensive parameter descriptions\n- Agent prompts are 3-5 sentences minimum with clear role definition\n- Team structure follows a logical workflow pattern\n- Each component is reusable and modular\n\n=== AVAILABLE TOOLS ===\nYou may assign any of the following tools to the agents you create\n**read_file** (ID: file_reader)\nRead the contents of a file\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to read [required]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: The contents of the file\n\n**write_file** (ID: file_writer)\nWrite content to a file (creates file if it doesn't exist)\n\nParameters:\n  - file_path (str): Path to the file to write [required]\n  - content (str): Content to write to the file [required]\n  - mode (str): Write mode: 'w' to overwrite, 'a' to append (default: 'w') [default: w]\n  - encoding (str): File encoding (default: utf-8) [default: utf-8]\n\nReturns: Success message with bytes written\n\n=== EXAMPLE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM ===\n\nFor a task like \"Create a web scraping application that monitors product prices and sends email alerts when prices drop\":\n\n**agents.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"architect\",\n      \"name\": \"Software Architect\",\n      \"system_prompt\": \"You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in designing scalable applications.
